**Vampire Clicker** is a browser-based clicker/incremental game. 

Players take on the role of a newly-minted vampire, mindlessly seeking nourishment. As they gain experience and money, they may progress to more complex goals and actions.

The game is built using VanillaJS, so there are no external dependencies.
