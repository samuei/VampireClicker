>You are a blood-sucking creature of the night. 

>You require the blood of the living to animate your soulless corpse every sunset. 
Perhaps as you grow and learn about the night, you will become able to do more than simply feed and sleep. 
Perhaps. Or perhaps not.

**Vampire Clicker** is a browser-based clicker/incremental game. 

Players take on the role of a newly-minted vampire, mindlessly seeking nourishment. 
As they gain experience and money, they may progress to more complex goals and actions.

The game is built using VanillaJS, so there are no external dependencies.

## Local Editing

Some browsers don't like Javascript imports from "file://" and will complain about CORS even though the 
origin is so similar that it's *in the same folder*. That's silly, but you can work around it by hosting 
your code locally. If you have Python 3 installed, you can just run the command `python -m http.server` 
in the command line from the repo's folder and it will set everything up. There are myriad other solutions 
to this problem, so if you have one you like, do that.
